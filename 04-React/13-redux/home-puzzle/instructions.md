You are tasked with creating a React Redux application that allows users to manage an image album. The application should provide the following functionalities:

Add Images: Developers should be able to add images to the album by providing the image URL.

Update Images: Users should be able to update the URL of an existing image in the album.

Delete Images: Developers should be able to delete an image from the album.

Your goal is to implement the necessary Redux actions, reducers, and React components to achieve the desired functionality. Make sure to organize your code appropriately and follow best practices for using Redux with React.

Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools you are familiar with to complete the exercise.

Good luck!
